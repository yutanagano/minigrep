grep, rustified (TOY SOFTWARE)

> Based on a tutorial project from ["the (rust) book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).

This is a simple re-implementation of the popular command-line tool grep, written in rust.
This is not meant to be a serious replacement for grep, but rather to facilitate my own learning of the rust language.
